# 🏊‍♀️ Week 1: Build Swim & Smile Camera

**Week**: September 7-13, 2025  
**Goal**: Create a camera that detects faces and draws pool-blue frames around them!

## 📋 Task Checklist

### Coding Tasks
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create `src/app.py` with face detection code
- [ ] Implement pool-blue frame drawing (RGB: 0, 188, 212)
- [ ] Add swimming-themed labels and text
- [ ] Test camera functionality

### Documentation Tasks  
- [ ] Draw a simple flowchart showing: Camera → Face Detection → Pool-Blue Frame → Display
- [ ] Add flowchart image to `assets/` folder
- [ ] Update README.md with flowchart reference

### Sharing Tasks
- [ ] Record 15-second IG Story showing the camera feed
- [ ] Say "This is my AI camera!" in the video
- [ ] Post to private Instagram account
- [ ] Share IG Story link in this issue

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Camera opens and displays video feed
- [ ] Faces are detected and highlighted with pool-blue frames
- [ ] Frame color matches specification: RGB(0, 188, 212)
- [ ] User can quit with 'q' key
- [ ] User can save photos with 's' key

### Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand basic camera operations
- [ ] Learn about face detection algorithms
- [ ] Practice Python programming
- [ ] Explore computer vision concepts

## 🤔 Big Question for Discussion
**"How does AI know it's your face? Can it make mistakes?"**

Think about:
- What features does the AI look for in faces?
- Could it confuse a photo of a face for a real face?
- What happens if someone looks different than usual?

## 📸 Deliverables

1. **Working Code**: `src/app.py` that runs and detects faces
2. **Flowchart**: Visual diagram in `assets/week1_flowchart.png`
3. **IG Story**: 15-second video demonstration
4. **Pull Request**: Submit code for Dad's review

## 🏆 Reward
Complete all tasks to earn your **😄 sticker**!

## 💡 Helpful Tips

- Test your camera first with `python src/app.py`
- Make sure your room has good lighting for face detection
- Have fun with the swimming theme - you're the Pool Party PM!
- Ask Dad for help if you get stuck
